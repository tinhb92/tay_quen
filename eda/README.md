Instacart dataset:

4 to 100 orders of a customer are given (we will look at this later) and we need to predict the products that will be re-ordered. 

The last order of the user has been taken out and divided into train and test sets. All the prior order informations of the customer are present in order_products_prior file.  

We can also note that there is a column in orders.csv file called eval_set which tells us as to which of the three datasets (prior, train or test) the given row goes to.
